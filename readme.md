This is the "compiled" version of the hackinator, which doesn't need
the hackinator itself to be already installed to run.  It was created
with:

    hack --apply --destdir hackbin hackinator.recipe

Github pull requests for the hackinator should not be made against
this repo since it is created automatically from the hackinator
source; instead pull requests should be made against the [hackinator
source repository](https://github.com/awwx/hack).

See the [hackinator readme](https://github.com/awwx/hack#readme) for
installation instructions.
